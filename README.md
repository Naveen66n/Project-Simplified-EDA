Did you know that 80% of a Data Scientist's time is spent on preparing and cleaning data, not building models?

Surprising, right? But here’s the kicker — this foundational work is what truly drives impactful insights!

Recently, I explored EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), and it was an eye-opening experience. Here are some key takeaways:
✅ The importance of feature engineering and how it enhances model accuracy.
✅ Small improvements in data preprocessing can lead to significant performance gains.
